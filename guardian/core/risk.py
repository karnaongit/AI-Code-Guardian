"""
AI Code Guardian - Risk Scoring Engine (Day 7)
================================================
Implements the Composite Risk Score formula from the Master Design Document:

    CRS_finding = (CVSS_Base*0.30 + ML_Confidence*0.20 + BCS*0.25
                   + Reachability*0.15 + EPSS*0.10) * 100

    Risk_PR = max(CRS_findings)*0.60 + weighted_avg(CRS_findings, by_severity)*0.40

    Security_Score   = 100 - Risk_PR
    Alignment_Score  = BAS   (Business Alignment Score, 0-100)
    Maintainability  = MQS   (Maintainability Quality Score, 0-100)
    Overall_Risk     = Security_Score*0.50 + Alignment_Score*0.30 + Maintainability*0.20

Where ground-truth CVSS/EPSS data is unavailable (no live NVD/EPSS feed
wired in yet), conservative severity-derived defaults are used and clearly
flagged in the output so they can be swapped for live threat-intel values
in the Days 8-10 integration.
