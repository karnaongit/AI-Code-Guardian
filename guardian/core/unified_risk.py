"""
Unified Risk Engine
===================
Produces the final risk assessment from every deterministic and
contextual signal the pipeline gathered.

The composite formula from the original design document is preserved —
existing consumers of `guardian.core.risk` see no change — and extended
with the signals the refactor made available:

    severity            deterministic detector output
    confidence          detector self-report, discounted for AI findings
    exploitability      reachability from the UST data-flow pass
    business impact     business-domain and business-tag context
    business intent     alignment score from requirement-vs-code comparison
    quantum exposure    CBOM readiness, as a *separate* dimension
    dependency risk     SCA + KEV/threat intel
    AI confidence       contextual signals, capped and clearly attributed

**Nemotron never assigns the final score.** It contributes bounded
signals — a migration urgency, a business-impact judgement — which this
module folds in with fixed weights it does not control. A model that
returns "CRITICAL, confidence 1.0" for everything can move a finding's
contextual factor within a capped band and nothing else.
